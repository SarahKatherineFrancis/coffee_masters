<h1>Display Flex and Grid Practice</h1>
<p>This is a web page where I practiced using the CSS display: flex and display: grid properties to create layouts.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To view the web page, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.<

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>In this project, I gained hands-on experience with the display: flex and display: grid properties, which are two powerful tools for creating responsive and flexible layouts in CSS.</p>

<p>With display: flex, I was able to create a flexible nav and table that can expand or shrink to fit its contents. I also learned how to use various flexbox properties like justify-content and align-items to manipulate the layout of the container's children.</p>

<p>With display: grid, I was able to create a two-dimensional grid layout that can handle both rows and columns. I learned how to use properties like grid-template-areas, grid-template-columns, and grid-gap to customize the grid layout and create responsive designs.</p>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>In the future, I plan to continue practicing with display: flex and display: grid to gain a deeper understanding of these powerful CSS properties. I also plan to experiment with combining these properties to create even more complex and flexible layouts.</p>
